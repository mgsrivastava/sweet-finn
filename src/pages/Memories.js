            Something that got left out of the main "Finn Story" was the
            all-important Finn the Movie! A very poorly planned and executed
            feature film with a production budget of $0 starring Finn as "Finn."
            A fun behind the scenes tidbit is that Finn actually also played the
            role of "Dr. Lampchop." The makeup department did a great job of
            distinguishing the two characters even though they had the same
            actor.

            I have never been much of a pet person. After Alka and I finally
            agreed to Meghna's repeated requests to get a cat in Jan 2011, I
            went with Meghna to Wendell, NC to get Finn. Over the subsequent
            days, weeks, months and years, Finn totally endeared himself even to
            me! He was such a sweet and beautiful cat. I think he won the heart
            of everyone that met him.

            In the nine years he lived with us in Cary, Finn brought endless joy
            and warmth to our home. I loved his gentle, sweet nature and how he
            would plop in front of me for pets and belly rubs. I have such vivid
            memories of his soft fur and bright blue eyes. His playful spirit
            kept us entertained, as he explored every room (even the forbidden
            ones), window sills, and the screened porch. Finn's memory remains
            deeply cherished in my heart. I will forever miss his tender purrs,
            soft snuggles, and the endless curiosity that made him so special.
            Rest in peace, sweet Finn. You were a gift to our lives.

            Finn was the most beautiful cat I had ever lain eyes on and his
            personality fully matched. With the sweetness of a candy cane and
            the coat of vanilla ice cream, his cuddles would never fail.
            Whenever I got the pleasure of pet sitting, the first course of
            action would be to immediately say hello - and his hugs were always
            divine. I would listen to his pitter patters as he would follow me
            to the food bowl, with purrs filling the corridor. Though he was not
            always keen to stay close by, he would always ensure to say goodbye!
            Love you so much Finn, and will always miss your presence.

            I have countless memories of the time I spent with Finn, but one
            that stands out is the first time we tried to feed him wet food. It
            seemed like Finn struggled to identify it as food and instead just
            licked it like the silly baby he was. He did eventually learn to
            devour the wet food with the same gusto as he did his dry food. Finn
            was such a sweet and lovely cat, and I will always love and miss
            him.

            I wanted to take the chance to share my memory of Finn. He was
            absolutely the most cuddly furry cat I have ever seen. I remember
            him sitting on the carpet like a majestic lion, and then suddenly
            rolling on his back to be petted. I'm gonna share a picture of Finn
            with my mom which I think is beautiful. She too remembers him very
            fondly.

            I remember Finn when we used to visit your old house in Highcroft
            Village. He was handsome and very cute too, always so well behaved.
            I know he was very loving and loyal especially to you. Even though
            Finn is no longer with us, the love and joy he gave you will stay
            with you forever.

            I have so many beautiful memories of dinner get togethers at your
            home. Finn was always affectionate (although all the kids running
            around must have been so overwhelming). Your love for him was so
            pure and visible in the way you held him. I can't even imagine the
            pain of not having him around. Mia and all of us send hugs and love
            to you.

            As one year anniversary of Finn's passing is approaching we all are
            remembering him in a special way. What a lovely life of Finn! Like
            your dad, I'm not much of a pet person though after reading Finn's
            story and your love for him I felt a jolt of joy. It's extremely sad
            to loose someone close to you, spending 13.5 years together and
            above all loved one like you loved Finn - your only love at first
            sight! At the same time inevitable does happen and that's the
            almighty's way which we all have to accept and make the best out of
            it, which you have done so by sharing such a lovely story of you and
            Finn! I'm confident that he is still showing you with love in its
            absolute purest form. Love you both!

          <p>Today marks one year without my sweet Finn.</p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            When I was in college, I used to count down the days until the next
            visit home as "Finn-less days." On the day of my travel back I would
            rejoice that no Finn-less days remained. But now, unfortunately, all
            I have are Finn-less days. It's crazy to think that 365 of them have
            passed. I still think about Finn every day, and I miss him. I miss
            his trotsky-esque footsteps, his voluminous fur, his many meows
            (from sweet to indignant to almost whimpering). I miss his giant
            head. His fixation with the shower in the Davis condo. His DEEP
            sniffing of a bush outside the Madison Valley house where many
            passing dogs would pee. I miss Finn burrowing season. The way he
            would step on my hair and meow until I let him under the blanket.
            The satisfied purr that would start up immediately once he was
            safely snuggled against my side. I miss the little droplets of water
            that he'd get on his nose after drinking from the fountain. I just
            miss my little guy. I'm comforted knowing that he was spoiled
            absolutely rotten for his entire life, showered with love not just
            from me but from many others. Thank you Finn, for all of the
            beautiful memories you've left us with. I feel lucky to have so much
            to miss.

            It took some time for Finn to warm up to me, after we first met. And
            I won't say that I never took offense (he would swat at my head, my
            hair, my shoulders, when I walked past him on his cat tree,
            something that happened so frequently they were coined "drive-bys"),
            but I did understand it. I was bigger. I was stronger. Some may say
            more beautiful. But most of all, I was superior to Finn in one
            crucial way that I'm sure he held a grudge over: I am much, much
            better at being comfortable.{" "}
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Finn had a talent for it himself, but he was raw, unformed. He
            figured out how to burrow to keep himself warm in the coldest
            months, worming his way solo under the covers of a made bed by
            himself for Megh to find him as a lump at the end of the day. But he
            had no idea what a blanket cave was, or that he could even tap into
            something incredible by pairing a burrow with a warm body.The
            turning point in our relationship was the first Christmas we spent
            together, alone, with Meghna gone and galivanting on the East Coast.
            That's when we formed a truce that blossomed into a beautiful bond.
            Through persistence, hard work, and a Megh-sized hole in his heart,
            I was able to coax him under the blanket with me in bed. First, he'd
            stay for seconds. Then minutes. Then, for hours at a time.
            Eventually, I'd have one hand on my phone, or propping up a book,
            and one hand on Finn, his body temperature soaring and his chest
            crackling with ambient pleasure. Drive-bys became a thing of the
            past.{" "}
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            It would've never worked if Meghna were there. He was desperate,
            pathetic, and pliable with her gone. Together, we built a Christmas
            miracle: Finn was even more annoying than before. From that time on,
            Finn came to realize that the best burrowing is burrowing done with
            the people you love, and that if you simply scream in their ears at
            six in the morning, you don't even need to burrow yourself. They'll
            sleepily lift the blanket up for you, and let you right inside.
