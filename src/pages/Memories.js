            Something that got left out of the main "Finn Story" was the
            all-important Finn the Movie! A very poorly planned and executed
            feature film with a production budget of $0 starring Finn as "Finn."
            A fun behind the scenes tidbit is that Finn actually also played the
            role of "Dr. Lampchop." The makeup department did a great job of
            distinguishing the two characters even though they had the same
            actor.

            I have never been much of a pet person. After Alka and I finally
            agreed to Meghna's repeated requests to get a cat in Jan 2011, I
            went with Meghna to Wendell, NC to get Finn. Over the subsequent
            days, weeks, months and years, Finn totally endeared himself even to
            me! He was such a sweet and beautiful cat. I think he won the heart
            of everyone that met him.

            In the nine years he lived with us in Cary, Finn brought endless joy
            and warmth to our home. I loved his gentle, sweet nature and how he
            would plop in front of me for pets and belly rubs. I have such vivid
            memories of his soft fur and bright blue eyes. His playful spirit
            kept us entertained, as he explored every room (even the forbidden
            ones), window sills, and the screened porch. Finn's memory remains
            deeply cherished in my heart. I will forever miss his tender purrs,
            soft snuggles, and the endless curiosity that made him so special.
            Rest in peace, sweet Finn. You were a gift to our lives.

            Finn was the most beautiful cat I had ever lain eyes on and his
            personality fully matched. With the sweetness of a candy cane and
            the coat of vanilla ice cream, his cuddles would never fail.
            Whenever I got the pleasure of pet sitting, the first course of
            action would be to immediately say hello - and his hugs were always
            divine. I would listen to his pitter patters as he would follow me
            to the food bowl, with purrs filling the corridor. Though he was not
            always keen to stay close by, he would always ensure to say goodbye!
            Love you so much Finn, and will always miss your presence.
