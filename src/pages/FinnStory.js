          And this website is a celebration of Finn's wonderful 13.5 years on
          this planet. Starting from the beginning, so bear with me. Here's
          another Finn pic to tide you over:
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={under_that_bike_thing_1} />
        <br></br>
        <p>So, from the beginning.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          For most of my childhood, my parents were understandably wary of us
          kids having any pets that required work beyond a once-a-day feeding.
          They didn't want to get stuck with all the work caring for a creature
          while we were off frolicking - or whatever it is kids do. This policy
          held fast for years, leading us through a parade of colorful fishes
          and one Russian Tortoise. (Excitement over the addition of the
          tortoise cooled significantly once we realized he did nothing besides
          sleep, eat, and sit under the heat lamp. So basically a perfect
          existence, no notes.)
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          It must be said that this genre of pet left a lot to be desired in the
          interaction department, and by the time I got to the tween years I was
          absolutley clamoring for a mammal. Cats seemed to be less work than
          dogs (not to mention cleaner) so I narrowed my focus and did some
          research on affectionate and easy to care for breeds. I came across
          the "ragdoll" breed (named for their floppiness) and found a breeder
          in our area. Obviously this was before I knew that you should always
          adopt pets from a shelter, but in my defense I was a snot-nosed
          13-year-old who didn't know much about anything.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          But I did know that I *needed* a cat. And after eventually wearing my
          parents down they contacted the breeder. Luckily, there was a kitten
          immediately available for adoption. He didn't have a name yet - the
          breeder referred to him only as "cream mitted," which described his
          coat coloration and pattern.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={email_screenshot} />
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Huge shout out to Kelly for being slow to respond and giving us the
          chance to swoop him up! Here he is at the breeder's house, wide-eyed
          and adorable:
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <div className="multi-img-container">
          <img className="multi-img" src={cream_mitted} />
          <img className="multi-img" src={cream_mitted2} />
        </div>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          On January 12, 2011 - the same day that we heard about Kelly's folly -
          my Dad and I drove about 45 minutes to Wendell, NC to pick up the
          kitten. Since it was so last minute I held him in my lap wrapped in a
          towel until we could get to a pet store to buy a carrier, litter box,
          and all the essentials.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Meeting Finn is the only time in my life that I've experienced love at
          first sight.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={upside_down_kitten} />
        <br></br>
        <p>
          And I was thrilled. Finn was a bit more apprehensive. Rishie also
          seems apprehensive though I don't know why.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={baby_animal_with_me_and_rish} />
        <br></br>
        <p>
          I named the new kitten after Finn from Adventure Time (13-year-old
          logic but honestly I stand by it). He quickly settled in to his new
          home.
        </p>

        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={baby_animal} />
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Here he is in the cat bed we got for him, nick-named the "Cozy Cove."
        </p>

        <p>Testing the wine stock for quality</p>

        <br></br>
        <p>
          Finn grew quickly, and unfortunately I didn't have a smartphone in
          those days so we have fewer pics. I do have these hilariously bad ones
          from a photoshoot with Hannah
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <div className="multi-img-container">
          <img className="multi-img" src={photoshoot_with_hannah_1} />
          <img className="multi-img" src={photoshoot_with_hannah_2} />
          <img className="multi-img" src={photoshoot_with_hannah_3} />
        </div>
        <br></br>
        <p>Shiven got in on the action too.</p>
        <br></br>
        <div className="multi-img-container">
          <img className="multi-img" src={photoshoot_with_shiv_1} />
          <img className="multi-img" src={photoshoot_with_shiv_2} />
        </div>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Soon Finn's coat turned the advertised "cream" color and he started
          filling in his cove much more thoroughly
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={finn_in_cove} />
        <br></br>
        <p>
          And his personality grew too. We quickly learned Finn was friendly to
          the point of acting more like a dog than a cat at times. Following the
          humans from room to room, greeting houseguests, rolling over for belly
          rubs, and generally basking in our attention. He won over every single
          person who met him in a matter of minutes.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={rish_holding_while_hannah_pets} />
        <br></br>
        <p>Just look how happy Nani is to hold him.</p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={with_nani} />
        <br></br>
        <p>Mom looks pretty thrilled too.</p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={mom_petting} />
        <p>He even got Dad on his side.</p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={dad_petting} />
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Perhaps his most dog-like trait was his penchant for licking things.
          He would lick people almost compulsively, especially if you scratched
          him in certain areas. But he also licked floors, walls, cabinets,
          blankets, plastic packaging, tape, electronics you name it. Examples:
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <div className="multi-img-container">
          <img className="multi-img" src={licking_fox} />
          <img className="multi-img" src={licking_rishies_thumb} />
          <img className="multi-img" src={licking_cabinet} />
          <img className="multi-img" src={licking_lint_roller} />
          <img className="multi-img" src={licking_hair} />
          <img className="multi-img" src={licking_chops} />
        </div>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Finn also lived up perfectly to his ragdoll breed description. He was
          extremely comfy with being held and handled.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={rish_holding_boy} />
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={with_shiven_on_couch} />
        <br></br>
        <p>And he was exquisitely floppy.</p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={floppy_guy} />
        <br></br>
        <p>We call this one rug mode.</p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={rug_mode} />
        <br></br>
        <p>
          In 2013 we added another family member: Jules (adopted from the
          shelter! Remember to always adopt :). Finn wasn't exactly thrilled to
          have another cat distract from his majesty, but he was reasonably
          polite to the newcomer.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <div className="multi-img-container">
          <img className="multi-img" src={meeting_kitten_jules} />
          <img className="multi-img" src={jules_paw_on_face} />
        </div>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Obviously that second pic is from when Jules was fully grown, but it's
          way too good to not include. Here's another good one:
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={under_christmas_tree} />
        <br></br>
        <p>
          If you haven't noticed yet I have way too many pictures of these
          animals. Rishie is easily the most excited in this one.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={both_animals_with_rish} />
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Jules was a very sweet little guy, but less outgoing and prone to
          troublemaking than Finn. Don't think you should be in there buddy...
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={troublemaker} />
        <br></br>
        <p>He's not supposed to be on the parents' bed and he knows it.</p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={bedroom_interloper} />
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Finn was also an intrepid explorer. Here he is scouting out the porch.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <div className="multi-img-container">
          <img className="multi-img" src={screen_porch_boy} />
          <img className="multi-img" src={exploring_porch_2} />
        </div>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          This could get him into trouble sometimes, like when he slunk after me
          into an unfinished storage room then disappeared among the boxes.
          Unaware he was in there, I shut the door behind me. This incident
          culminated in a multi-hour search that included us wandering the
          streets of the neighborhood looking for him. Eventually Finn was found
          happily resting under the rafters, totally insulated from the
          commotion.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={looking_up_sweetly} />
        <br></br>
        <p>
          I also have to share this photo of the time we got him a "lion's cut."
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={yikes} />
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Poor guy. I promise the intentions were pure - I wanted to help him
          stay cool during the hot, humid North Carolina summer. Rest assured
          the lion's cut was never repeated. And like the sweet guy that he was,
          Finn forgave us quickly.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={sweet_pic} />
        <br></br>
        <p>
          After many years of having Finn as a cherished member of the family,
          the time came for me to head out of state for college. Saying bye to
          Finn was harder than saying bye to my parents in a lot of ways. While
          at school I could easily talk to them, but I wasn't able to interact
          with Finn at all. So whenever I came home during breaks my first step
          was always to scoop Finn up.
        </p>

        <br></br>
        <p>
          I also incessantly bothered Mom, Dad, and occassionally Rishie asking
          them to send me cat pics on snapchat. I now humbly present some of
          their best ones from this era:

          Soon after I finished undergrad and moved to Davis, California for
          grad school, we shifted the cats cross-country so I could take care of
          them. After a lot of preparation, we successfully got the animals
          through the requisite car and plane rides and settled into their new
          digs.

        <p>
          Finn in particular took it upon himself to thoroughly inspect the
          home. Here he is testing out the sink:

        <br></br>
        <p>
          The years in Davis were pretty tough for me personally. Grad school, a
          pandemic, a break-up, Jules moving out (don't worry, he's doing great
          in his new home). But through it all, Finn was a constant source of
          joy and comfort.

          In February 2022 we left Davis for the new pastures of Seattle. Finn
          was a champ during the 11-hour drive.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={car_ride_to_seattle} />
        <br></br>
        <p>
          As expected, his chill personality meant that he immediately settled
          in.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={on_bed_in_seattle} />
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Although he did get a bit overly excited by the baseboard heaters and
          even managed to singe his fur on them the first night.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={heater_boy} />
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Finn might not be the brightest, but why bother when you look like
          this?
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={golden_hour} />
        <br></br>
        <p>Anyway, here's Finn helping out with furniture setup.</p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={dresser_assembly_helper} />
        <br></br>
        <p>And inspecting the cat tree placement.</p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={sweet_guy_on_cat_tree} />
        <br></br>
        <p>Seems to be to his liking.</p>

        <br></br>
        <p>
          Finn lived out his golden years in Seattle, where he had a wonderful
          time. His favorite thing was probably the outdoor access. In Davis, he
          was limited to a small balcony, but here he had a whole backyard.
        </p>

        <img className="standard-img" src={finn_with_petals} />
        <br></br>
        <p>He loved rolling around on the concrete.</p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={flopped_on_concrete} />
        <br></br>
        <p>And regrettably he loved swiping his tail around the mulch.</p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={mulch_aftermath} />
        <img className="standard-img" src={mulch_aftermath_2} />
        <br></br>
        <p>He enjoyed visits from the family.</p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={parents_visit_wallingford} />
        <br></br>
        <p>And time in the snow</p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={animal_in_snow} />
        <br></br>
        <p>Finn also met his step-sister Subaru.</p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={with_subaru} />
        <br></br>
        <p>
          And, like a typical older brother, made himself comfortable in *her*
          cat bed.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={subaru_bed_interloper} />
        <br></br>
        <p>She got him back though.</p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={subaru_in_cove} />
        <p>
          Although Finn and Subaru didn't get past the point of uneasy
          tolerance, he did become very close with step-mother Nina.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={tongue_out_with_nina} />
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Here he is contorting himself to sit on Nina when she had a migraine.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={migraine_helper} />
        <br></br>
        <p>
          And with a seal toy that she bought for him, appropriately named Finn
          Jr.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={with_finn_jr} />
        <p>
          Crucially, Nina taught Finn the joys of the blanket cave (previously
          he preferred to sit on top of blankets). Under the covers time became
          an important part of our bedtime and morning routines, especially
          during the winter.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <div className="multi-img-container">
          <img className="multi-img" src={blanket_cave_1} />
          <img className="multi-img" src={blanket_cave_2} />
        </div>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Sometimes the meowing, headbutting, and hair stepping could begin as
          early as 5am. But the disrupted sleep was worth the sight of Finn
          worming his way under the covers and burrowing between us, purring
          loudly.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={blanket_cave_3} />
        <br></br>
        <p>
          I'm about to get to the sad part, but before I do I want to direct you
          all to some special gallery features! These are basically collections
          of themed Finn photos, because frankly I have way too many photos
          (literally thousands) and couldn't fit them all in here on the main
          page.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>(TODO: links to gallery)</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Eventually, Finn's kidney disease progressed into Stage 4 and his
          appetite and energy levels started to drop. During his last few weeks,
          we tried various feeding strategies, fluids, and vet treatments, but
          it became clear that it was his time.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>He was able to enjoy moments in the backyard.</p>
        <br></br>

        </div>
        <br></br>
        <p>And got lots of extra special treats.</p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={licking_hydracare} />
        <br></br>
        <p>And of course tons of love and cuddles.</p>
        <br></br>
        <img className="standard-img" src={madison_valley_backyard_3} />
        <br></br>
        <p>
          On the final night we stayed up and kept Finn company. Even though he
          was in physical discomfort he still wanted to be near us.

        <p>
          Finn passed away peacefully on April 5, 2024. Thank you to Lap of Love
          and Dr. Michelle for giving him a compassionate and gentle end.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          I also want to thank Dr. De, Dr. Heeren, Katie, and the rest of the
          team at Northwest Veterinary Hospital for providing Finn with
          exceptional medical care. Thank you to family for your unwavering love
          and support. And to Nina for being an incredible partner and helping
          with vet appointments, administering meds, and a million other things.
          To everyone reading this who got this far: thank you. It's lovely to
          see how many lives Finn touched and it makes me happy to know he's
          continuing to shine his light from the beyond. If you have photos,
          videos, or memories of Finn please text or email me as I'd love to
          hear them and add them to the site.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Finally, thank you Finn for being, without exaggeration, the best cat
          in the universe. Thank you for being there for me. For letting me bury
          my face in your fur when I was upset. For patiently tolerating me when
          I would grab your head like a hamburger. For spreading joy to all
          those around you. For showing me love in its absolute purest form. You
          were an amazing companion and I adored every second that I got to
          spend with you.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>I will love you forever.</p>
